# Gosome

Gosome is basically a wizard to setup go web apps using the standard library and a phew dependencies to give a framework-like feel.
This project exist for me to setup go web apps faster based on what I need.

I have realised that I don't like most frameworks, but I like Go.
Thus this project was born.

## Installation

- Though Go:
- Arch:
  Maybe one day

## Usage

The wizard helps setup with options for basic project structure and dependencies.

### Project structure

The project structure is defined in the `project-template/` directory.
The TUI has a descriptions for each directory

### Dependencies

This project is built on the back of giants.
Optional dependencies include...

- [sqlc]()
- [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose)
- [templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ)

I would also like to take time to appreciate [bubble tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)

## Customizations

If compiling from source, you can edit the `project_template` file as you please and change to `config.json`
to reflect the changes.

## Future possible additions

If this gets enough traction, I plan on adding these features

- Tailwind
- eslint
- HTMX
- plugins?
