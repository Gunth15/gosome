## database

To finish setting up your database, you need to install a database driver(sqlite is installed by default). Configure the `sqlc.yaml` and `.env` file to your liking.

## templates

Templ is use for generating html templates.
`templ generate -path ./internal/templates -watch` can be used to watch and generate new html.

## api

If your generating a spec from an using openAPI, I recommend Redocly.
